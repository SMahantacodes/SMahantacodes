# About me.


**SMahantacodes/SMahantacodes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a customer segmentation model using clustering techniques in Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data storytelling techniques to make insights more compelling.    
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love finding cool insights in everyday dataâ€”like my music playlists or spending habits.
